ML4T笔记 | 02-04 The Capital Asset Pricing Model （CAPM）
Time: 00:00:36Definition: A portfolio is a weighted set of assets.ime: 00:02:05Given the portfolio and return of the stocks in it, calculate portfolio returnSolution:
portfolio return = 75% * 1% + (-25%) * (-2%) = 1.25%Time: 00:00:39The Market Portfolio usually referring to is an index that broadly covers a large set of stocks.The market portfolio is a combination of those stocks in a certain weighting.SectorsSo it's not unusual to break up these large markets into individual sectors.Note: some stocks have surprisingly large weightings (e.g. Apple and Exxon each are about 5% of the S&P 500) thus have a strong effect on what happens to this index.Time: 00:03:46The capital assets pricing model equation.: The return of a particular stock, i, on a particular day,
: the return for a particular stock due to the market.Where do we get this  and this ?Depends on how the daily returns for a particular stock  related to the daily returns of the market .Time: 00:04:21Of the two plots, which one has higher alpha and which one has a higher beta?Solution:
Correlated with SP500, ABC clearly has a greater slope than XYZ, therefore higher β. It also has a larger Y-intercept (α).Time: 00:00:36consider passive versus active in that contextBoth active managers and passive managers agree that the stock moves each day is most significantly influenced by the market .The CAPM the  is 1) random and 2) expected to be zero.Active managers believe they can predict  relative to the market.a passive investor believes the capital assets pricing model,
Just buy an index and hold it.and active investor believes they or some else can find .Time: 00:03:07the return for the entire portfolioNew way to calculate BetaTime: 00:02:04Consider the implications of the CAPM, and implications in upward markets and downward markets.If we're in upward markets, do you want a larger beta or a smaller beta? And if we're in downward markets, do you want a larger beta or a smaller beta?solution:Time: 00:00:28Now, we are on to ways that you can potentially beat the marketTime: 00:01:31Time: 00:01:38Total Time: 00:22:12
